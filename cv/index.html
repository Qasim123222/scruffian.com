	<h2 class="first">About me</h2>
	<p>
		I love making things.
	</p>
	<p>
		I combine an unusual set of skills, with both a keen eye for visual detail, and a logical, methodical approach to problem solving.
		These complimentary abilities make me well suited to roles which use the rigors writing code to achieve an attractive aesthetic.
		This mix of skills enables me to understand the limitations and requirements of design and development and bridge the gap that so often exists between them. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Since April 2010 I have been building Boticca.com. As the first employee my roles have been many and varied.
		I took the site from its conception through to launch in October 2010.
		Since then we have been creating new features, and iterating on our user experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a thorough understanding of how to make the web accessible, usable and machine readable; but I strive beyond this, to create interfaces which are not just intuitive but also fun to use.
		I love learning; I actively seek out better ways of working. I find innovation exciting.
		I contribute to open source software.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I am not making things for the internet I like to make things out of wood, food, music, words, paint and dirt.
