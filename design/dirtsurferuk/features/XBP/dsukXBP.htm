      </b>XBP (xtreme boarding @ priory) is a brand new course which opened at
      the beginning of June. Overlooked by a huge manor house, it runs between
      the orchards of the huge priory farm estate. We were joined on our ride by
      Bryn - a friendly four-wheeler, and new girl Becky, who we eventually persuaded
      to have a go on Bryn's board. The whole place has a really friendly
      attitude and is a really good example of mountain boarding at it's best -
      no-one cares what board you're riding or how good you are. This was quite
      encouraging as we stacked so many times on the kicker ramp! After about
      five attempts we had worked our the basic technique and ripped the grass
      up with our (new!) pads and the dirtsurfer's headset. Meanwhile Bryn was
      shooting down (and up) the huge freestyle jump and pulling all sorts of
      crazy moves.</font>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana">At the top of the slope is the start ramp
      for the half pipe and boarder cross course. The half pipe run is very fast
      and is made especially hard for dirtsurfers since it runs directly into
      the speed bumps, which as their name suggests need to be ridden quite
      slowly (or your nose plants into the face of the next hump). This was
      especially a problem for Tim, who was riding without a brake!</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana">On the boarder cross course more
      attention was required to choose a good line as there were some ground
      clearance issues, but after a few practice runs we all managed to make it
      down in one go(!), and by the end Bryn had it totally nailed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana">The learner and slalom runs also provided
      a lot of entertainment and opportunity for racing. They also allowed us to
      demonstrate how fast the dirtsurfer really can be, crusing past Bryn and
      carrying us round the bottom of the hill and starting back up the other
      side.</font></p>

      big freestyle jump was somewhat more daunting. We started off by trying to
      roll in from the side - to give us a bit more control over the speed,
      which was ok when it worked, but approaching the lip at an angle led to
      quite a few crashes. Ben tried rolling in from the top of the start ramp
      (with his brake fully on!) and still managed to get a bit air off the lip.</font>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="1">After much persuasion we finally got
      Becky off the bench and onto a board. Using elbow pads on her knees, she
      sped down the hill and only stacked once!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="1">XBP is a really good center, with
      something for people of all abilities, from the nursery slopes to the half
      pipe. The other great thing is that there is still a lot of potential for
      improvements too, so the center should get better every year. The lift to
      the top is also another huge bonus as well as the great atmosphere.</font></p>
