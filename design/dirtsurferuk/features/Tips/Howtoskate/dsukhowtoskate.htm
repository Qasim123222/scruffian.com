            in keeping upright try and keep your rear leg bent, but held firmly
            in position. as always with things like this, you go where you
            look,&nbsp; so concentrate on where you want to go, not on the front

            doing 2 long
            pushes before putting your front foot on, to give the board enough stability.
            this is good advise but it's not set in stone. if something else
            works better for you then do that instead.</font></td>

          <td width="500" height="15"><font size="1" face="Verdana">again,
            advise which is often true is relax, enjoy yourself and don't get
            frustrated.</font></td>

  <tr>
          <td width="500" height="28"><font face="Verdana" size="1">when you
            have mastered this and your balance on the board starts improving,
            it becomes less important to keep putting your front foot back on.
            then you can really start pumping up the speed by really kicking
            with your front foot.</font></td>

            at the pictures of guy setting the land speed record on the
            dirsurfer. he is crouching down over his rear foot. this makes the
            board go much faster by cutting out all of the wind resistance. this
            may sound ridiculous, but if you try it along side a friend on a
            dirtsufer or a even a bike (as long as they don't pedal), you notice
            how much quicker you go. you can achieve this by just crouching
            down, but if you work your rear foot out of its binding, then this
            allows you to crouch over it and get much lower. try it - you'll be
            surprised</font></td>
