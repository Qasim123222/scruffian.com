      Downs runs like a spine straight through Kent, covered with fields and a
      smattering of sheep. As we drove along the feet of this stretch of the
      downs (westwell),
      we scanned the hills looking for some good dirtsurfing. Up to our left we
      spotted a suitably steep field, characterized by what looked like a large
      meteorite (hence the name). On the left of
      the field there was a steep drop with no run out and a barbed wire fence
      at the bottom.
      Taking the run at an angle made it a bit less steep and gave us a longer
      ride as well as allowing us to run out along the bottom of the hill. We
      then started carving across the huge field, getting across it three times
      without even reaching the bottom.
      Taking the run at an angle made it a bit less steep and gave us a longer
      ride as well as allowing us to run out along the bottom of the hill. We
      then started carving across the huge field, getting across it three times
      without even reaching the bottom. On the other side of the field we found
      a weird ditch thing which sloped round creating the perfect natural berm. We had just got this sorted as
      we heard cries of &quot;oi, what do you think you're doing?&quot;.
      Thinking better of answering this question we made out way back slowly across the
      field to the road, followed by the farmer, who seemed to be intent on
      scaring the sheep as much as possible with his land rover and dogs.&nbsp;On the way back up to the car we spotted a small wood on the right,
      leading up to the top of the field. The path was fairly straight, but had
      some sharp corners, and ditches either side. We hammered down between the
      foliage either side, ducking overhanging branches and leaning right into
      the bends, before losing control and ploughing into the nettles and
      brambles or nose-diving into the ditches either side of the path. Then we climbed a tree (you don't need a reason).
      We went home via our local forest where we burnt around on the main
      path a bit before having a go at building a jump.&nbsp;This was not all
      that successful as the landing ramp was just bumpy scrub land covered with
      weeds and </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"> running straight into a bush.&nbsp; </font></td>

      rough idea of a good shape - more will follow when we have this sorted out
      - or does anyone have any ideas? The North Downs has lots of great
      fields ideal for boarding. You have to be careful to check for rocks
      before you begin the run though, as some slopes are covered with large
      ones which have been known to buckle wheels! However the good slopes seem to be owned by
      unfriendly farmers who don't realize the
      surfing potential! (<a href="http://www.maxtrack.com">Have a look here!</a>)&nbsp; </font>
