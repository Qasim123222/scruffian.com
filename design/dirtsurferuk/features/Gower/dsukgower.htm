      the best place for surfing in Wales. Around the beach lie large sand dunes
      which looked like they would make great riding, with chutes, drop off and
      loads of other possibilities. During the day the sand was very soft
      because it was walked on, so we tried it earlier in the morning, hoping
      that they might be wetter and firmer. They weren't. After many failed
      attempts and a few good ones, we moved up to the hill that overshadowed us.</font></td>

      big and we were too scared to go
      to the top (it it a lot bigger than it looks in the photos). This terrain
      was good for Will, who is just learning to ride, except
      that the landings (although softened by sheep poo) were much harder. The
      ride down was still fairly challenging as it was really rocky and the path
      had large sections cut away. After a series of good runs and busted knees
      we had a few more ideas on how to ride the dunes, and got back down to the
      beach with a body board.</font>
