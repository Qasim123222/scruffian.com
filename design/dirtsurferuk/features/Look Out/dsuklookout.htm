      trip in to the depths of bracknell forest.</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana">&nbsp; </font>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana">&nbsp;After
      warming up a bit on some of the wide gravel paths we soon found some
      twisty singletrack and got stuck in. It was surprisingly easy to hold your
      course along the thin paths and even to get smoothly round some of the
      sharper corners. It wasn't long before we came across an obstacle&nbsp; -&nbsp; a
      fat log blocking the path. I tried to jump this a few times, and although
      me and the dirtsurfer made it over, we did not to do together, as the picture
      shows!&nbsp;We wound our way
      through the forest, picking up speed on some of the steeper paths.
      I tried jumping a smaller log, which was much easier! </font><font size="1" face="Verdana">Then
      we noticed a small opening in the undergrowth above us.&nbsp;A little
      exploration revealed some seriously twisty track which was so overgrown
      you had to crouch to make it through some sections. Perhaps surprisingly
      this track was made especially difficult as the path was not on much of a
      slope. Since the board gains stability with speed, the slower run down
      this slope made the board unstable and the track harder to ride. After landing in
      various shrubs, we were sent us speeding back to the main path again
      from which we noticed some steep chutes made by mountain bikes. </font><font size="1" face="Verdana">These
      really got the adrenaline pumping (even if the irate walker complaining us
      being in the way of the trees didn't!). It was difficult to kick off from
      the top of the chute, since the start was almost vertical so the board
      touched down, but as soon as
      you got rolling the speed picked up very quickly and would have been
      enough to attempt the jump built at the bottom (with more guts and
      protection!) I
      decided not to use the bikers run out but instead roll into the undergrowth to
      kill off the speed which worked pretty well, although I was probably lucky
      not to get a puncture!</font></p>

      had been hoping for.</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"> Unfortunately the sun makes the pictures quite bad, but way above our heads
      loomed a long steep slope. The surface was very uneven, the gradient steep
      and the run out long. Perfect.&nbsp;I admit that I didn't have the guts to
      try it from the top, but even starting from about 10 meters down the run was
      sketchy. This goes to show that the limits of this board are easily
      stretched but also that there are a lot of challenges left to attempt.</font>

      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana">The look
      out has plenty to keep you amused for a long time - the forest is very
      big. Unfortunately it takes some looking to find the best parts of the
      wood. However, there is a huge range of riding for almost all skill
      levels, from wide shallow paths, to crazily steep slopes with no path, or
      impossibly twisty singletrack! It is unsuitable for beginners though as
      there are not long grassy slopes, and falling off on gravel is very
      painful. Don't travel especially, but if you are in the area definitely
      check this out.</font></p>
