        <p>it's basically just a load of pictures i didn't want to use on a
        photo set.</p>
        <p>often people say things are rubbish just to cover themselves, when
        really it's actually quite good, but this page is actually complete
        rubbish. why are you still reading it. and yes you guessed it. all this
        writing is just here to give time for the photos to load, so if they are
        there then why are you still reading it?</td>

        i still haven't got the hang of riding the spine yet. apparently you
        have to steer away from the way you carve, and it's easier with 20in
        wheels. a little help...</td>

      <td valign="top" width="232" align="center">this is the spine again. i say
        that because otherwise you might think it was a dodgy take off or even
        dodgier landing. i thought that the spell check wouldn't like
        &quot;dodgier&quot; but there's no red line. odd. i told you this page
        would be rubbish
        <p>in this photo i have my gloves. i have since lost them so now i have
        even bigger calluses on my hands. i think they are at PORC somewhere,
        which reminds me - seb you still owe me for that inner tube from PORC,
        but&nbsp; don't worry about it!</p>
        <p>after PORC we went somewhere else on the train and when i got to the
        station i had forgotten my gloves.&nbsp; the train wasn't due for about
        5 minutes so i bombed it back home (a couple of minutes ride) looked
        around for the gloves, couldn't find them so i rode back. the train was
        just about to leave as i got on it. that was fun except i realised i had
        lost my gloves.</p>
        <p>i really need to write something else just to fill up this space</td>

        in the background that is an office chair. i don't know why it's at the
        jumps but then i don't know why most of the stuff is there. i think its
        a demolished house or something.</td>

        becky took most/all of these photos i think. that's how me and tim are
        both in it. don't tell me it's rubbish, i already know. now becky's
        gonna take offence at that. too late.</td>

        i think tim too think. he had about 10 goes and got one better than this
        too i think, but this is ok except the pads look a bit dumb. i might get
        some new ones.</td>
