These photos are from a day in about february at the orange trails. i can't
remember where i was, but i wasn't there, so tim got these photos with an
old camera. he then opened the back up with the film still there, which is how
the photo above happened. it's cool. most of the pictures are of tim, cos seb is
actually good at taking photos</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">This day kind
of marks the rebirth of these trails. nothing happened here for about 6 months,
but we went back cos they were dry, and now they are totally different. It's
easier to build trails that are half built already.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I think trail riding is unlike most other sports. In a lot of sports a lot
depends on money. Stuff like skiing, sky diving and most other adrenaline sports
require some significant financial support to be able to do. There are a lot of
sports where it makes very little difference how much money you have, like
football, and i guess most non adrenaline sports. Trails are a bit different.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">How good your trails are is nothing to do with how much money you have. Even
if you can afford to buy land and hire a digger, it still takes hours of hard
work to shape the dirt and get it riding well. So what counts is how much work
you put in. The harder you work, the better your trails are. You reap what you
sow. That's good.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Ridings the same too. You only get better through
hard work and practice.</font></p>

        the differece. Two different turnbar pictures. I think that's the old
        school name for them.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">One good thing about old pictures is you can see
        progression. Tim can do full xups now, so he won't be happy with these
        pictures, but seeing the pictures will remind him that he has
        progressed.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Another good thing about
        pictures is that they keep you motivated. Very often people only ride
        with friends, or because their friends do. That's good as people can
        motivate each other<br clear="all">
        <img border="0" src="2.jpg" align="right" width="341" height="392">For
        people who don't have a good scene, or a scene at all, looking at other
        people stuff on the internet gives you that same motivation to ride. ok
        so it's not as fun as actually riding with people, but if it keeps you
        riding then it has to be good.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Seeing other people's trails
        also motivates you to go out and dig something new.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">These photos however are
        rubbish. Even if they weren't blurry and grainy as well as washed out,
        they aren't even of good jumps. They were taken about 3 months ago and
        since then about 3 times as much has been built at the trails.</font></p>

Trails are a lot of hard work, especially when kid are always kicking at them.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">I
        guess the point is that riding trails is one of the most fun things you
        can do. Ok so there might be other things that are fun, but most of them
        are hard to do. You can't make the perfect wave on your doorstep. unless
        you make it out of mud.</font> </p><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">When the work has been done,
        you can ride everyday for as long as the sun lets you. How many people

        summer anyway...</font></p></td>
