</span>i found these <a href="hoggs/index.htm" target="_blank">very old pictures
of hoggs green</a>. haha.</p>

<p align="center">and yak asked for a link to his new site: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/theshovelload" target="_blank">theshovelload</a>
it's really good, so go there now.</p>

<p align="center">some tips on internet browsing: when i want to click on a
link, instead of just clicking it, i right click it and go to open link in a new
window. this means you can continue looking at the page you were looking at,
which the new page loads in a new window. this is not always a good idea, but if
you had done it on the link above, it would have loaded but the time you had
finished reading this. use it wisely.</p>

</span>i have been away for a few days not riding. this has made me stiff and
not smooth. yuk.</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;i have been working on a new look for the site which
will happen when i get my camera back, hopefully this week.&nbsp;</p>

me around</a></p>

<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: overline">050603<br>
</span>today we finished both lines. that's two 6 packs. it's a good feeling. i
am so convinced that they are going to be destroyed now that i almost did it
myself so i wouldn't be so annoyed. i guess i am just paranoid because i have
never had trails this good.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="oldtrails.htm" target="_blank">a page of old pictures</a>.
it's rubbish by the way.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://www.benmarwood.co.uk" target="_blank">ben

</span>well jessops finally decided to look at my camera after having it lying
on the proverbial floor for 5 weeks.<br>
the said it's too badly damaged to fix so they are gonna replace it. good.
but&nbsp; they could've told me that a few weeks ago.<br>
anyway i should have a new camera the end of next week so then i'll be able to
get some media. hopefully it will be dry by then.</p>

<p align="center">some idiots came down to the trails the other day on quad
bikes. i think they were gypsies as the live in a caravan the other side of the
river. obviously it was impossible to ride the trails on the quad bikes so
instead they just pushed them over the jumps. thanks. when i suggested that they
pushed them round the jumps instead of over them, one guy tried to start a fight
by pushing his beer belly into me. wierdos.</p>

<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: overline">030603<br>
</span>whats going on? well it's wet so not riding, but sorting out drainage.</p>

my exams are done. revision is so boring and exams suck, but
i'll never have to do another one again. in my whole life. ever.<br>
to see how boring revision is, <a href="window.jpg" target="_blank">look at some
window pictures</a>. i took them all from the window of my room.</p>
<p align="center">this weekend we went to north wales for a cross country ride.
the uphills were a bit rubbish, but the downhills were really good.<br>
it was really good to spend all day riding with friendly people, and maybe it's
made me fitter so i can dig for longer.<br>
a lot of the singletrack flows really nicely like trails.<a href="xc/index.htm" target="_blank">
some pictures here</a></p>
