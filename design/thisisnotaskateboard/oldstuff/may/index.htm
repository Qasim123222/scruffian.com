      <P>220503<BR>one exam left then i am free forever. riding this weekend. 
      and the rest of the summer.</P>
      <P>skaters are total pussys. I was at the park at about 5 yesterday and 
      this guy was trying to get up the guts to drop in on the fun box. he was 
      there for about an hour and he kept wussing out and never did it. he 
      borrowed my bike for a bit and i was getting bored so i picked up his 
      board and wandered over to the bow. I had never ridden a skateboard 
      before, but i managed to drop in on the second attempt. he was a bit 
      annoyed i think!</P>
      <P>check out this good little site - <A href="http://blewbmx.tk/" 
      target=_blank>blewbmx</A><BR><IMG src="index_files/peckx-up.jpg" width="640" height="512"></P>
      <P>160503<BR>it's a bit embarrassing. i am getting more hits on my site at 
      the moment than i ever have before, and it's rubbish at the moment. i do 
      usually have proper updates, not just stolen pictures. give me a few 
      weeks, my camera will be back and i'll be riding and then there will be 
      real updates.</P>
      <P><IMG src="index_files/tlog.jpg" width="962" height="446"><BR>ok this picture is from <A 
      href="http://www.swtrails.com/" target=_blank>SW trails</A>. their trails 
      got plowed. to look at the old site go <A 
      href="http://www.swtrails.com/html/home2.html" target=_blank>here</A> it's 
      good.</P>
      <P><BR>150503 one down 3 to go. and it's all going wrong</P>
      <P>anyway it looks like rain on saturday so you people won't be able to 
      ride. too bad, but secretly i'm pleased! i'm off to ride the park even tho 
      i should be revising...</P>
      <P><IMG src="index_files/indown.jpg" width="600" height="426"><BR>so where is this picture? who is 
      it? who took it? does it matter?</P>
      <P>120503<BR>its raining. the only good thing about that is i can't be 
      distracted from revision. my camera will be done in a couple a weeks 
      jessops said. a few people are coming to ride the trails, which i cool, 
      but i have an exam at the exact same time so i can't play. looking forward 
      to a jam even more because of that. </P>
      <P><A href="http://www.crankonline.co.uk/" target=_blank>crank online</A>. 
      this site has some amazing pictures of wisley, but my favorite has to be 
      <A href="http://www.crankonline.co.uk/pictures/nonsuch/1html.htm" 
      target=_blank>this</A> picture of nonsuch. that looks so good. I wasn't 
      going to do a thing on crank online as it has had so few updates lately, 
      but then i found out that james' camera is broken, with which i have much 
      sympathy, so i have mentioned it. then when i went to steal a picture i 
      saw it said not to be used without permission, so i wasn't going to again, 
      but then i found that picture of nonsuch which rules. </P>
      <P>110503<BR><A href="http://www.urbanwarfare.org/" target=_blank>urban 
      warfare</A> is probably the most hardcore trails site on the web. 
      certainly that i know of. i am too scared to steal a picture off the site, 
      but there are so many good ones it would be hard to choose. if you've not 
      seen this site then you are missing out. it was updated a few days ago. 
      (the pictures take a while to load tho.) </P>
      <P>100503<BR>today was the first day for about 3 weeks that i haven't been 
      to the trails. i busted up my ankle and wrist yesterday at the trails. i 
      thought they'd be ok, but i woke up and could barely walk. i decided in a 
      way it was quite good as i could get on with my revision, and then my 
      ankle would be healed by the time the exams were done, so i would take a 
      break from riding for a few days.</P>
      <P>i took tim's bike to the bike shop to get a new bb, and it only had one 
      pedal so that was interesting. i managed until about 8oclock without 
      riding, but i was so bored by then that i had to go out. manualing is so 
      fun, and is one of the least harsh things on your body, so practiced that 
      for a while. my ankle feels better for it too.</P>
      <P>that was boring<BR><IMG src="index_files/transfer.jpg" width="400" height="267"><BR>this is from 
      <A href="http://www.geocities.com/firsttransmission" target=_blank>first 
      transmission</A>. this guy has his own private land with trails on. he's 
      luck. it's a cool site.</P>
      <P>090503<BR>on the news today, cricket was relaunching its image to make 
      it less boring! i read somewhere someone saying they thought bmx was badly 
      marketed. i think that's all stupid. firstly cricket is boring. secondly 
      you shouldn't have to market a sport to make it popular. if its good then 
      people will want to do it anyway. i guess other stuff can put people off, 
      like people with attitudes and stuff. it's up to the people who do the 
      sport to project the right image. most people i know who ride bikes are 
      friendly. when i started riding, if i passed a cyclist, they always said 
      hi to me, even roadies, so i started saying hi back. i hope this kind of 
      thing gives cycling a good image. it's interesting to see how people see 
      the sport tho - look <A 
      href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1346698.stm" 
      target=_blank>here</A>.</P>
      <P>080503<BR>this site changes more than my boxers at the moment.</P>
      <P>you know that honda ad everyone's into at the moment? <A 
      href="http://www.angelfire.com/ms3/soundfiles4/rappers_delight.html">here's</A> 
      the track that's on it. (rapper's delight - the sugarhill gang). its meant 
      to be one of the first rap records. its seven minutes long and very old 
      school. gets a bit boring tho.</P>
      <P><IMG height=173 src="index_files/index2jpgallgood.jpg" 
      width=469><BR>simon at <A href="http://www.digtrails.com/" 
      target=_blank>digtrails</A> has been making a quality site about bikes for 
      a long time. it's good to have site that you can rely on being updated so 
      often, especially in times like this when a lot of websites are dying. 
      that's probably not a bad thing - it's like riding i guess, progression. 
      and space for new sites to do new stuff. anyway digtrails has another new 
      look, probably one of it's best, so thanx si.</P>
      <P>070503<BR>today i set up a high jump thing over the big jump. jumping a 
      rope makes it harder for some reason. my hair is getting too long to ride 
      with. it keeps getting in the way and i can't see what i'm doing. i rode 
      ramps with charlie for a bit. charlie doesn't have any front teeth. i 
      guess that's cos he's 6. the ramp was cool tho and we had some fun.</P>
      <P><IMG height=190 src="index_files/19.jpg" width=550><BR>today i went to 
      a cool site called <A href="http://www.iowtrails.fsnet.co.uk/" 
      target=blank>IOW Trails</A> it's a bit of a mix of loads of styles, but 
      the site is well designed, and it's good because theres lots of different 
      types of riding, but it's all in one place. have a look at the videos.</P>
      <P>060503<BR>since i have no real news, i am gonna talk about another 
      site! and steal a picture! does anyone know how to stop jumps 
cracking?</P>
      <P><IMG src="index_files/61.jpg" width="500" height="375"><BR>yeah this picture is from a site 
      called <A href="http://cafe.cic.hull.ac.uk/~icb00jpi" 
      target=_blank>progression</A>. it is really good, but not easy to find 
      because of the weird address. i like this picture because of the shadow, 
      but there are loads of good pictures on the site. go and look</P>
      <P>050503<BR>there was a may fair in the village today. it was about as 
      rubbish as normal. we cleared out the garage today too, and there's a huge 
      pile of stuff about as big as a car for the bin men. i couldn't bear to 
      throw my old bikes away tho so they are hidden behind the garage. 
      shhhh.</P>
      <P><IMG height=428 src="index_files/0a-pho-pete-turndown.jpg" 
      width=786><BR>this is a picture from <A 
      href="http://www.geocities.com/instuition" target=_blank>instuition.</A> a 
      good site, with a good update. stu, the guy that makes the site, thinks 
      that websites copy magazines too much. he's probably right, but i can't 
      really copy magazines at the moment as i can't afford them. so if my site 
      looks like a magazine, that's probably because i copied someone else's 
      site! i wish i had trails like this, and could do tricks like this and 
      could take photos this good. keep digging and riding...</P>
      <P>040503<BR>i am missing my camera.</P>
      <P>yesterday was mostly bad and a bit good. we had just sorted out getting 
      permission to dig at the good trails, when some woman comes along and 
      moans about us digging up her bulbs. we told her we has permission from 
      the land owner, but she claimed that it was her land not his and told us 
      to put it back...</P>
      <P>the only good thing was riding the other trails. they were flowing 
      quite well and some guys from some other trails not to far came down for a 
      look on their way to a party. they're coming back to ride on monday, which 
      should be fun.</P>
      <P><IMG src="index_files/indown.jpg" width="600" height="426"><BR>this picture is from <A 
      href="http://www.wehatethecouncil.8k.com/" target=_blank>we hate the 
      council</A>. i don't hate the council here, but i do like the photo! go to 
      the site</P>
      <P>020503<BR>in preparation for going back to uni to do exams for 2 weeks 
      i have taken the appropriate steps to allow the site to be updated from 
      geocites. pretty isn't it.</P>
      <P>things are kind of good and kind of bad. the rain is good cos you can 
      build but bad cos you can't ride. revision is bad and a broken camera is 
      bad, but headcorn is slowly getting good. more on that later</P>
      <P>i haven't got a lot of time for updates and stuff what with exams but i 
      guess a lot of people are in the same position. in which case, go and 
      revise instead of looking at my site! i finish sooner than some people 
      though, so hopefully i can be keeping your revis
