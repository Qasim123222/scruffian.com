      i rode the big 4 pack today. it's been made nice by rain. i want some
      pictures but the camera is broken. dug at the tiny trails. they are funny.
      gave me a puncture tho
      <p>also i just spent about and hour just riding around outside my house.
      there's a few kids who play out on their bikes and it's fun riding with
      them as they don't have an attitude. just fun.</p>
      <p>some cool sites:<br>

      things have been quite slow on this site recently. i am busy with revision
      at the moment, so i have no time to ride much at all. the other problem is
      that my camera is broken. i am gonna take it in to be fixed on monday, but
      i'll be without for 4-6 weeks probably...
      <p>the trails are good tho which is more important. i made the 2nd lip of
      the big line today. it looks really nice. the landing is smooth now too.
      just have to wait for the rain to stop so i can ride it! thinking of a
      dirt jam in the summer when the trails are smooth.</p>

      the new trails are really hidden. they are in the middle of a really tight
      wood with no footpaths in. i guess they'll be found eventually, but
      they'll be there a while. they are going to be really small so everyone
      can ride them.

      there have been&nbsp; some problems with the new video. sorry. i didn't
      upload the entire file by mistake so i think the end is missing - it
      should be 3:50mins. also, please remember to right click any movie links
      and go to save target as...
      <p>i don't know what file formats people use, and i don't have space to
      provide lots of different ones. so if you can tell me what file formats
      you use, or what media player then that would be cool. thanks</p>
      <p>in other news, we are starting a new, small, trails site for the local
      kids who don't ride, to get them into it. it's gonna be well hidden</p>

      i have been filming over the weekend. the results can be seen by right
      clicking the banner in the movies section. there's no great tricks, it's just some kids
      riding their bikes.
      <p>i have also put up the pictures from porc last week. there are a few
      good shots, but i should have taken more really. i was too busy riding tho.
      <a href="http://www.khill.tk" target="_blank">knowlhill</a> has moved and <a href="http://www.digtrails.com" target="_blank">digtrails

      </span>i finally found something i am better at than tim! moonlight
      riding. it was really cool - we were digging until it was dark, but there
      was a full moon so you could still see stuff. so we rode the trails in the
      moonlight.
      <p>i still haven't got round to putting up the pictures from porc, but i
      told james i'd put up a picture of him so there's one on the left. i'll do
      it at some point...</p>

      went to porc yesterday. some pictures will appear on the site in
      the next few days i hope, but right now it's nice outside so i am gonna
      ride. i didn't get many photos from porc either as i was too busy riding.
      i think that's good tho. i got a few nice videos too but they can wait
      until i make a long movie

      i am going back to uni to do exams, so it is very possible that there
      won't be an update for a week. hopefully that means that there will be a
      good one in a week!
      <p>went to sebs at the weekend and rode pitch trails. there are some
      pictures uo inside. joe did his first jump too!

      </span>some new pictures i took in the garden. look at the top one -&gt;
      <p>today we built and rode. there is now a running 9 pack. it's not
      totally smooth but it fun to ride. we also found out that black mill
      trails will probably not be knocked down which is really good as now we
      will have 2 sets of trails.<br>

      some of the work we have been doing on the small line. we have been riding
      it quite a bit too, which is all fun. it doesn't look like tim's gonna
      make that gap, but it's so smooth he does easily.</td>

the time was 8:45.</p>

first rain in ages. although rain is always bad, there is a silver lining, as some of the earth of the trails was too
dry to pack down. there wasn't enough to make much of a difference tho so a lot of it is still crumbling.</p>

<p>we have been concentrating on the orange trails a lot recently. there is a lot of building site stuff and fly tipped
junk, and stones everywhere. the ground is also concrete so we were running out of dirt. only yesterday
