the picture above is of josh's trails. they are looking really good. i went and
dug there for a bit today. in a few month's it's gonna rule. more pictures soon
i hope.<br>
<br>
i am going home at the weekend to ride. tim has built up the old trails. he says
the first jump is about the same size as the first at crusties (below). i think
it's probably bigger.<br>

found a new park which is a bit closer, called sol joel park. it's ok but the
ramps are really slippy, and hard to get used to. met a cool guy from south
africa who skates. we took some photos which are <a href="../../../../designprojects/thisisnotaskateboard/oldstuff/february/sol_joel_park.htm" target="_parent">here</a>.
he is looking for some people to start a ska band with so if anyone's
interested...<br>
<br>
i managed to fix my computer. i worked it all out myself and saved over a
hundered pounds. yahoo. this picture is of the malfunctioning chip!
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: overline">240203<br>
</span>just a few things for now - more tomorrow. becky and me took some photos
but lost them thanks to sipix.<br>
<br>
does anyone know the <a href="http://www.commitment.tv" target="_blank">commitment.tv
</a>video that starts &quot;you should know....that i would never let you go...&quot;
who is that song by? i guessed it was by take the fool as the chorus sounds a
bit like that and they are a local band. so i went to <a href="http://www.geocities.com/takethefool/">their
site</a> to see if it was. i never found out but i saw on their site that the
were playing at the purple turtle in reading with a band called <a href="http://www.onedayelliott.co.uk" target="_blank">one
day elliott </a>- this was weird cos i used to know some of the guys in this
band and my fried designed their album cover. irrelevant story isn't it?!<br>
<br>
go to <a href="http://www.knowlhill.com" target="_blank">knowhill</a> - that's
impressive for a weeks work.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: overline">210203</span><br>
haha - read tim's mini update in the guestbook. sounds good - i wanna ride. tim has been moaning that the font is too small to read so i hope it's ok now.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: overline">200203</span><br>
rode the park for a bit today. tim has built up the old trails so now there's a 4 pack there. i wanna go and ride it.<br>
<br>
i have been thinking about updating the main bit of the site, but i can't think how to make it better so there's not much point. i am quite pleased with that layout - i think it works well. i could make it a pop-up window but that might be annoying.<br>
<br>
i went to <a href="http://maddox.xmission.com" target="_blank">this site</a> yesterday. i think it's pretty funny but you have to read stuff. oh i nocticed that <a href="http://satobmx.tripod.com" target="_blank">sat/ox</a> has the same overline on it's dates. i didn't copy them i promise!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: overline">190203</span><br>
i am pretty dumb. yesterday, riding my bike home i was doing silly front wheel taps on just about everything as i was bored, like walls and stuff. i was riding on the pavement and i tried planting on the fence next to me. i was one of those grid/mesh fence things that you have at schools as it's cheap. anyway as i landed on it, i was sprung back across the road. 
fortunately there were no cars or would have been dead. when i got home i went to get my key out of my pocket, but they weren't there. so i go back to where i came off and there were my keys, my 1£ coin and my 5£ note. my wallet tho was nowhere to be seen. by this time it was too dark to see properly so i cancelled all my cards and went back early this morning. it was gone. that's why the site is updated before 9 today.</p>

sorry if you've had trouble getting onto the site in the last few days -the hosting people had it all messed up. sort now. i have been keeping busy with work although my computer is still busted. gonna go home soon and build up the old trails ready for the summer<br>
<br>
the picture above is another one from barnet. it's not a great riding shot but i 
still like it cos of the way ot shows the contrast between riding and ordinary 
life. those people were quite annoyed too as they thought i was going to ride 
into them!<br>
<br>
yesterday i found a huge pile of dumped bikes so later i might go and see if there's anything good there - i want to make a comedy bike. back to work.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: overline">170203</span><br>
had my first go ever on blades on saturday with sim and joe. it was quite cool - like ice 
skating only easier. we had quite a bit of fun at about 1am using only one skate and pushing with our other foot. if you think blading 
is rubbish then right click

for a few weeks i had been wondering why knowlhill.com was called that. the guy 
that makes it is from henley and his trails are called wrestle and aren't in a 
place called knowlhill. then on friday night on the was from reading to 
birmingham we took a bit of a stupid route and ended up going through this tiny 
village called Knowl Hill, a few miles from henley. so i guess that is where 
knowlhill joe lives. i was looking around as we drove through and i saw some 
dirt and trails - i wonder why joe doesn't dig there?... maybe he does.</p><br clear="all">


<p><span style="text-decoration: overline">140203</span><br>
yestoday i did about an hours digging down at josh's trails. they look so good - they are really beefy. went to the park for a bit later. there was a guy down there on blades doing front flips without any protection which was quite impressive.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: overline">130203</span><br>
updating from the old uni computers today. site is hosted here now which is ok i think. it just means i can't update from my bed anymore! no riding due to all this computer stuff, but it's been raining pretty solidly so i haven't missed out. quite good timing really! if it dries up i may go down to the park later. <a href="http://www.knowlhill.com" target="_blank">knowlhill</a> is being good as always.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: overline">120203</span><br>
so my computer is totally dead. it looks like it's gonna be expensive, but that's my excuse for not updating for a while. it has taken me about 48 hrs to back up everything and try fixing it but i now know that it's hardware failure and sony want to charge me 37.50 just to look at it. i may not bother. in any case i have a load of work at the moment.<br>
<br>
last weekend rode with tim in reading and barnet. have a few photos but nothing brilliant. there should be one above. that's enough boring you.

<p><span style="text-decoration: overline">050203</span><br>
park in the afternoon today. it was dry but busy. didn't really learn anything new. it was a bit hard as there were so many people. tried a few tricks on the fun box. couldn't get a 360, but kickouts are being kicked out a bit more. bar spins are hard. oh tried fufanu's but only got it once.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: overline">040203<br>
</span>went to park again. it was totally deserted. some of the ramps were
really wet but the ground was dry. i think maybe that was the ice. just
practiced a few bits and then learnt something i don't know the name of - like a
180 but then you land over the lip? and i fell right onto the lip and hit my leg
bad. then it started snowing.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: overline">030203</span><br>
good day so far. woke up and it was sunny. i had a lecture at 9 so i just lay
there for a bit planning my day. i went straight to the park from my lecture and
got a couple of hours in. it was pretty dry and totally empty so i got on with
it. learnt quite a bit. i did the spine for the first time, badly. also learnt
(small) kickouts and 180s off the box. met this cool guy who rode an azonic.
talked a bit and then tried to clear the box. front wheel cleared it completely
and then my wrists hurt. then this guy showed me some more street in reading and
told me about his trails. gonna go down there sometime.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: overline">010203</span><br>
february it is then. feburary is usually pretty quick and if it's anything like
last year, warm. and then you guys can all go out and ride while i am stuck here
revising. as for now it's too wet to do anything so go back to bed. oh yeah the
picture about is another one made from those pictures at the south bank that
teena d sent me.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: overline">300103</span><br>
well all hopes of summer were truly dashed today. no much going on what with all
this snow and wind (and rain to come), so i'm gonna take this opportunity to
catch up on some work :(</p>
