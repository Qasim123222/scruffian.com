          </span>i got some photos of some street riding we did back in the days
          when it rained. they are in newstuff.<br>
          <img border="0" src="030315_0026.jpg" width="640" height="480"><br>
          i have been riding lots of trails every afternoon/evening which has
          been really good. the rain is coming...
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><br>
          <span style="text-decoration: overline">250303</span><br>
          went to the orange trails as we are not allowed to build black mill at
          the moment. it's ok down there. i got some photos if you look at
          newstuff. there's a few that are ok, but might get some better ones
          tomorrow.</p>
          <p>revision was really boring today</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: overline">240303</span><br>
          ok important news, listen up. we met the land owner of
          black mill trails. he was a bit annoyed but we explained the situation
          and said he would think about it. he was worried about being sued if
          we fall off or if trespassers fall down a hole. he's considering
          letting us stay on certain conditions but it depends what his lawyer
          friend says. could be very good or very bad. we'll see</p>
          <p>this weather is so good. whatever you do, just make sure you go
          outside for a bit cos it is so nice. it makes you really happy to be
          in the sun.</p>
          <p>oh yeah, got a new spade, as the picture shows. it's really a
          shovel. good for smoothing out stuff and carries lots of dirt</p>
          <p>found out today that you can find out if land is registered for
          free. that means you can keep enquiring until you find unregistered
          land. it only cost 45£ to register land and then you have your own
          land for trails. worth a try.</p>
          <p>there might not be many photos for a while - until i get a good
          camera, which might be soon. mainly cos i want to just ride loads. on
          the other hand photos are fun, so i might try to get some. see how it
          goes<br>

          </span>this is the berm we made. it's small but it does the job.
          should be able to clear the gap properly now, but need to wait for the
          landing to dry out (i know). have you seen the new busted video. i
          hate busted too, but the video has some good bmx stuff in. it's got
          some fairly basic tricks (no foot, etc.) and some cool suicides. the
          best thing tho is that it also shows a skater just rolling around
          while all the bmxers are pulling cool stuff.<br>
          <img border="0" src="beforeafter.jpg" width="639" height="240"><br>
          we rode trails quite a lot today. adjusted the other line at black
          mill - took out the first jump as the picture shows, to give more
          space for the run in to the second. there is a really cool transfer
          the now too. i think it looks cool.<br>

          this is what happened when we tried to ride a wet landing. there
          wasn't much left! these pictures are up in the secret trails site, but
          why<a href="http://www.secrettrails.freeserve.co.uk" target="_blank">
          go there</a> when you have just seen the update?</p>

          </span>rode black mill trails properly for the first time today. it
          was so good to be riding trails again. makes all the work seem worth
          it.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>we did keep on coming up short tho. it's hard to get the speed. you
          have to drop in off the road and then nail the berm.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>on top of that it is slightly uphill and the take off is wet. we
          took about a foot off the face of the landing, but we are probably
          going to move the take off back a foot too to make the gap a bit
          smaller.<br>
          <span style="text-decoration: overline"><br>
          </span>lots of fun...<br clear="all">
          <span style="text-decoration: overline">200303</span><br>
          did more to the run in today. you can see in the picture how much has
          been cut away. tomorrow afternoon the berm should be finished so it
          can be ridden properly for the first time.<br>
          <img border="0" src="030320_0002.jpg" width="640" height="480"><br>
          i saw on a bmx site about some riders destroying someone's jump,
          because they did it to them. that is so stupid. people have to work so
          hard for jumps. what is the point of destroying somone's jump, just
          because they destroyed yours. now there are 2 less jumps in the world.
          how is that a good thing</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: overline">190303</span><br>
          i rode black mill trails today. well i tried to. couldn't get the
          speed to clear it tho so i need to sort the run in out a bit more. put
          a berm in or something. oh yeah josh had to make the first at ditch
          smaller so he could clear it. he said &quot;i am not going home
          tomorrow until i've at least bailed the second&quot;. let us know how
          you got on.</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.sk8m8.com" target="_blank">www.sk8m8.com</a> is
          a great site. i have found loads of new parks with it.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: overline">180303<br>
          </span>i have begun revision. my life ends here. i am beginning to
          like these pictures of trails close up.<br>
          <img border="0" src="030318_0005.jpg" width="640" height="480"><br>
          i have been working most of the days leaving an hour or two for
          digging before it gets dark, which is quite good cos i can still get
          stuff done. tim tried to ride the trails the other day but he lost all
          his speed as the run in is uphill and round a corner. good planning.
          so we have been working on flattening out the whole run in and also
          gonna put a berm in for the corner. might be rideable by the weekend</p>
          <p>on friday i rode ditch trails, with pallets in the middle. i
          couldn't get the speed to clear it, but josh was gonna try on saturday
          so i wonder if he managed it.<br>
          <img border="0" src="030318_0001.jpg" width="640" height="480"><br>
          <a href="http://www.geocities.com/brookfieldtrails">brookfield trails</a>
          have been ploughed. it's making me wonder, with all these trails being
          plowed - should i buy the land mine are on. i probably have got enough
          money, but that would mean using all my savings. there are some other
          problems too. like i might move away from where the trails are if i
          get a job, if i ask to buy them then the land owner will probably go
          down there and see what we've done, so if he says no then he'll
          probably plow them. is it worth it? answers in the guestbook. i think
          i'll wait till i have a house and then have garden trails.</p>
          <p>where's trailscene? <a href="http://www.digtrails.com" target="_blank">digtrails
          </a>is being good.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: overline">160303<br>
          </span>some people are so up themseleves. on friday i went down the the park and
          to ditch trails. i met this kid at the bmx track. he was just learning
          to ride and stuff, and he was trying stuff, but he doesn't know
          anyone, or anywhere. i felt quite sorry for him so i thought i might
          be able to help him out and teach him some stuff. he was going on
          about how he could do 5 jumps or something but anyway i was&nbsp;riding
          round and i messed up a double, as i am prone to do from time to time.
          so anyway he was laughing and calling me crap and stuff so i just said
          &quot;good at making friends aren't you&quot; and rode off. his loss i
          guess.</p>
          <p>there's some new photos of the ditch trails up. they are ok i
          guess. the good one is below (it's a landing). the others can be seen<a href="030314.htm">
          here</a><br>
          <img border="0" src="030314/030314_0008.jpg" width="640" height="480"><br>
          ditch trails are looking sweet except they are cracking up a bit.</p>
          <p>i also did some wall ride that i spotted. i'll make a new picture
          set when i develop the film<br>
          <img border="0" src="030315_0004.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
          <p>oh yes, the other thing is that typo i made if you didn't see it. i
          have been back to black mill trails and the pickey didn't actually
          manage to do that much damage - build bulky. if you don't then you get
          the brookfield trails effect!<br>

          i have been ill. yesterday was the first day i didn't ride my bike for
          about 3 weeks. it was also the first day i never have to go to another
          lecture or lesson again. ever. that would have been much cooler if i
          didn't feel like a swollen, shivering, nervous wreck. not cos i don't
          have any more lectures - becasue i'm ill.</p>
          <p>so that's the end of my education i guess. except exams. i learnt
          some stuff probably, but i can't remember much right now. i still have
          a bit of a funny head. the weather forcast is dry for the weekend tho...

          it rained at all the wrong times on saturday, but i got some pictures
          of some silly stuff sliding on wet walls. it's on my real camera so i
          probably wont get the pictures for a year, but it'll be funny when i
          do.</p>
          <p>on friday we went looking for a skatepark on oxford road in
          reading. according to sk8m8.com there is one there but the map is
          wrong. it is supposed to be in the oxford road recreation ground. i
          rode for about 2 hours today looking for it and never found it. i went
          to just about every park down oxford road. does anyone know where it
          is. i thought it might have been destroyed but some kids said they
          rode there so i dunno. <a href="http://www.sk8m8.com/sk8m8/sitedetails.php?parkid=174&amp;view=over" target="_blank">it's
          here</a></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: overline">080303</span><br>
          there are some new photos of riding on friday morning (sol joel park).
          it rained in the afternoon so we just did some street. the thumbnails
          in the pictures section should be showing up ok now - there were some
          problems before. the whole site has a new look which i hope works ok
          but it might be hard to read stuff. think it's ok tho. nice and
          colourful.<br>
          <br>
          also nik's mini site has another update</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: overline">070303</span><br>
          not much time for an update now when there's riding to be done. also
          went to the cellar bar in bracknell. it was good. ben marwood was
          playing and he was clearly the best person there. look at his site: <a href="http://www,benmarwood.co.uk" target="_blank">benmarwood.co.uk</a>
          </p>

          two slightly more entertaining updates today. there is a new sections
          to the site with stuff i didn't know where to put, called xtras. it
          has some new dirtsurfing videos in. take a look if you have broadband.
          nik's mini site has also been updated with a few new pictures. all the
          new stuff is in newstuff, unsurprisingly. also i got rid of the pop up
          and stuck it there too.<br>
          <br>
          tim (and maybe seb) are coming here to ride. i thought we might be
          able to ride trails but i rained today. maybe just park then -
          hopefully some photos from that.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: overline"><img border="0" src="spot_the_rider.jpg" width="512" height="155" alt="spot the rider"><br>
          050303<br>
          </span>tim took the picture above when we went to barnet. spot the
          rider. the photos from barent are up if you go and look at the main
          part of the site.<br>
          <br>
          not much else is going on except i (practically) have friday off so if
          anyone wants to meet up to ride then let me know...&nbsp;</p>

          ok so what's new? well this weekend it was too wet to ride at the
          jumps so we just built them. the result can be seen by clicking the
          picture above or <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jamingben/secrettrails/index.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.
          If everything goes to plan there will be 3 good sets of trails within
          a mile of my house. they'll probably all get plowed tho. there's also
          pictures of the ditch trails, which look like they will be so good
          when they are finished.<br>
          <br>
          oh we did ride some other stuff on sunday tho. just a bit of XC/downhill
          stuff. it felt weird being on a bike with 26&quot; wheels again.
          riding without a back brake is hard too. (yes i did mean to type
          back).<br>
          <br>
          in other boring news, i saw a 24&quot; cruiser for sale today for 350£
          - good set up. also the guy across the road from me is selling his
          26&quot; orange trials bike. its new as he had the old one replaced by
          the factory when it was nicked!? good set up too. more details? - ask
          on the message board.<br>
          <br>
          and if you hate pop ups then haha</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: overline">030303</span><br>
          Welcome to my website. If you are new then please take a look around.
          if you have come here before, then sorry there's nothing new today,
          but there will be some new pictures tomorrow (i promise!).</p>
          <p>this weekend it was too wet to ride anything so we made some mud
          sculptures. (photos soon). This week i have a few other things to add
          to the site, so come back everyday and hopefully there will be
          something new</p>
          <p>(cool date btw)</p>
