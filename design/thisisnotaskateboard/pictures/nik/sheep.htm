      Flood Prevention
      <p><b>RELEVANCE:</b> None</p>
      <p><b>ARGUMENT: </b> Why not chuck all the sheep in Britain into the
      rivers that are under the most threat of flooding, as they would then soak
      up the excess water and the flood would be prevented.</td>

      </b>
      Why don't sheep shrink in the rain??<p><b>ANSWER:</b> They do!<p><b>STUDY
      (theory based): </b>The rain we experience in the temperate western
maritime regime (that would include Britain) is simply not intense enough and
is far too cold. This would have the same effect on sheep as the equivalent of a
      Tricycle, amongst the
washing machines would on cotton.&nbsp;<p>However, in areas like the tropics, such as the Amazon for instance,
where rain is far more intense and warm the sheep do shrink and almost
disappear completely.&nbsp;<p>Therefore, if someone tells you there are no sheep in the
Amazon they are lying, they are just very, very small.</td>

      </b>
      What happens to the white when the snow melts?
      <p><b>ANSWER: </b>Well, based n my first theorem, one could easily
      see how snow is simply a reunion of all the little sheep that have been
      affected by heavy rainfall.&nbsp;This is their mating season you see, and well
      because of the cold they are able to control themselves a bit more,
      that’s why you can’t see them moving. Then come the heat, the little
      sheep move apart and hide, leaving puddles of pee and other bodily
      substances, which scientists commonly call rain or snowmelt!&nbsp;
      <p>The reason we see them fall from the sky and hit our car wind
      screens is because their size makes them pretty light, so they can simply
      travel from places all over the world... and who said snowball fights
      weren't cruel??</td>
